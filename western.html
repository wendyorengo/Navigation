            <P>The values that africans held so dear have been erroded. Our morals no longer have any meaning to the african setting. From the way we dress, our language and genral mode of conduct.</P>
         <p>This  can be changed by going back to the drawing board on how much of importance our values were. How our dressing and skin coverage meant a lot to mostly the female gender and most importantly just have the sense of self worth.</p>

       <P>We used to live in a world of man build fellow man. Any progress to each individual was held with much esteem. It was a society of success for everyone was a benefit to all. Everything was drained to the mud was it became man for himself and God for us all. Man cares for himself and uplifting his own self is dear to thy heart. A neighour in suffering is of none relation to him.</P>
       <P>It is not late though, having the mentality of building each others castles and celebrating in people's succes will help build a better nation to live in.</P>
