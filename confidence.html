                <p>When I talk of self-confidence, I talk about the ability to take intitiative at all times. 
                    It doesn't mean you have to always be corect and perfect at the things you do, but basically having the courage to do them. No one is ever born confident; meaning it is a skill that is learnt and has to be natured to grow.</p>
            <p>A confident person is a good listner, displays composure, speaks with authority, asks for help freely, is not afraid to look silly and owns up to their mistakes.</p>
           
            <p>With confidence, you win even before starting and it comes from not always being right but not fearing to be wrong!!!</p>
