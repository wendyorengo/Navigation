                <p>“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”</p>
            <p>The book sheds light on the horrible experiences of Auschwitz and what they taught him about life, love, and our search for meaning. When all seems hopeless, why is it that some people push forward while others subside.
        
                I know some people who probably wouldn’t survive more than a day without their iPhone let alone having everything in their life that could possibly be taken ripped away. If Frankl’s experience is indicative, when this happens, we eventually seek peace within ourselves. If only to retreat from the terrible surroundings.</p>
                <p>Frankl suffered alot in prison, a fact that could have given him an option to give up and succumb to his present situation.</p>
                <p>He instead welcomed what he went through and took it as a source of hope and energy to give him the strength to continue pressing on.</p>
                <p>His meaning of life came from 3 things.Love, purposeful work and courage in the face of difficulty.</p>
                <p>For love: Frankl illustrates this with a stirring example of how his feelings for his wife — who was eventually killed in the camps — gave him a sense of meaning: His love for hiw wife kept him going. The mere thoughts of her smile, image and him having the impression of her answering him gave him a reason to keep going and reunite with this great love he had for the wife.</p>
                <p>For purposeful work: n thinking about the work he wanted to do after he was free, Frankl would get lost in fantasies about publishing his book, developing his theories related to Logotherapy and further contributing to the field of psychology. For example, when Frankl first arrived at Auschwitz, his nearly complete manuscript was taken from him. He would often visualize what this manuscript looked like, and write it over and over again in his head. This was just one way in which he found some meaning despite his circumstances. </p>
                <p>For courage in the face of difficulty: Frankl’s thought process gave him meaning and helped him push through the adversity of everyday life at the camps he was imprisoned at, Auschwitz and Dachau. Instead of thinking about the life he left behind, he focused on finding meaning in every little moment. Whether it was the thought of being reunited with his wife or his constant reflection on the ideas of Logotherapy, Frankl passed time by pondering what was meaningful to him. He found meaning in his condition of suffering, which is the human condition itself. </p>
                <p>Our thought process in times of difficulties, how we visualize our current situations contributes enormously to who we become in our closer futures.</p>
